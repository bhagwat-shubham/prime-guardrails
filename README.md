## PRIME Guardrails: Configurable Safety for Generative AI

A General, Low-Latency Safety Framework Implementation using Google Agent ADK

This repository contains the reference implementation of the PRIME Framework (Policy, Risk, Intervention, Monitoring, Evaluation) for the NeurIPS 2025 live demonstration.

It demonstrates a Router-Centric Agent that intercepts user prompts to a Text-to-Image model, applying configurable safety policies in real-time without retraining the underlying models.
