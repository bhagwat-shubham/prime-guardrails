Isn't it better to prove your point? The majority of the doubts about the homeowners here are still qualified, so why do you talk about online violence? Did you feel good about being labeled?"

You really have the same way of thinking as the Yellow Corpse in Hong Kong. The Red Guards in the Cultural Revolution are afraid to bow down and accept you as the boss. I suggest you be included in the surveillance list. During the period of maintaining stability, special affairs should be handled. What's the benefit of tearing up the society for you? How much did you charge British and American agents"
